# RFC_NAME

**Current State:** Draft  
**Author:** GITHUB_HANDLE

The opening section of the RFC is used to define the problem. The motivating issue must be clearly defined, and the requested changes must within the scope of the OpenTracing charter.

# Background
Relevant historical context is summarized here. Since Since OpenTracing is a standardization effort, successful proposals will usually be based on existing academic research and insustry solutions. References to any prior proposals or standardization efforts should also be included.

# Specification Changes
Changes to the abstract interface must be clearly defined. Language-specific interfaces will be implemented in a later phase, and the abstract interface contained here must be clear enough such that the changes can be ported to many languages without much deviation.

All expected behavior should be documented, in sufficient detail such that language-specific tests and examples can be generated from the descriptions.

# Use Cases
Concrete use cases must be provided, in order to guide testing and interface design, and assist reviewers.

# Risk Assessment
Risks, backwards compatibility, and potential for inconsistency are addressed.
