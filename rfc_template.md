# 0001: RFC_NAME

**Current State:** Draft  
**Author:** GITHUB_HANDLE

The opening section of the RFC is used to define the problem. Any relevant historical background should be included here. The issue must be clearly defined, and within the scope of the OpenTracing charter.

# Specification Changes
Changes to the abstract interface must be clearly defined. Language-specific interfaces will be implemented in a later phase, and the abstract interface contained here must be clear enough such that the changes can be ported to many languages without much deviation.

All expected behavior should be documented, in sufficient detail such that language-specific tests and examples can be generated from the descriptions.

# Use Cases
Concrete use cases must be provided, in order to guide testing and interface design, and assist reviewers.

# Risk Assessment
Risks, backwards compatibility, and potential for inconsistency are addressed.
